## Description

This program implements a Course Review Program which allows students to log in with a username and password or create an account if they don't already have one. Once they are logged in, they can submit a review for a class or see the reviews for the class. All the data is stored in a database called "Reviews.sqlite" which contains the tables Courses, Reviews, and Students. The User Interface has a Login and Logout as well as the Main Menu which allows students to submit or view reviews. The program is implemented as a JavaFX GUI Application and so all user interaction happen through the GUI.

To build and run the program, a few steps need to be followed. 

At first, copy the git link from this project's GitHub repository. 
On your IDE, create a new Project from Version Control, paste the git link and clone.
Once the repo is cloned, open the terminal and build gradle. 
This can be done for Windows using ./gradlew build command and for Mac using chmod +x ./gradlew
 command.
 Since this program uses JavaFx, Javafx needs to be downloaded. The location for the lib folder of the javafx needs to be copied. Then, on the IDE, under Run Configurations, add this location to VM arguments.
